\section{Introduction}
This section should introduce the problem we are considering, together with a rough overview of our approach, and a summary of our results. It should also contain a rough summary of what to expect in each of the subsequent sections.

\section{Agent Design}
This section should contain information about how our agent makes decisions. Minimax, heuristics, etc.

\section{Agent Training Methodology}
\subsection{David's Leaderboard Approach}
Intuition, justification, details.

\subsection{CMA-ES Approach}
Intuition, justification, details.

\subsection{PSO Approach} 
Intuition, justification, details.

\subsection{Agent Training Framework}
Details about how we monopolized entire clusters. Optimization tweaks (e.g. fast monte-carlo, Cython).

\section{Training Results}
Performance (strength of trained players, convergence of training, etc) of agent designs/training. Performance improvements from agent training frameework(?). Uptime on CS3243's leaderboard.

\section{Conclusion and Further Work}
Summary of approach, implementation details. Thoughts and further work. Acknowledgements (maybe).
